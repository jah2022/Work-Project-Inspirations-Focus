# Hey Everyone! I'm Joel - Software Developer

Work / Project Examples
-
- The purpose of this project is to introduce students to the using arrays in the Java programming 
language. The lab contained two classes; a main class that is named StudentNameLab2 and a class 
named Person. The Person class has four private fields that are declared as strings; firstName, 
lastName, address, and phoneNumber. The Person class should has public methods (functions) to 
access the private fields. The Person class has one method named Display() that displays the 
contents of the firstName, lastName, address, and phoneNumber fields. The main class creates a 
ten-element array of instances of the Person class.  Using a loop within the main method, it 
prompted the user to enter each person’s first name, last name, address, and phone number. That data 
populates the fields of each person object. Once all of the data entry is completed, the main class 
calls the Display() method of the Person class for each person in the array to display the contents 
of the fields.

- The purpose of this project is to introduce students to array-based queues using the Java 
programming language. This project contains three classes; a main class named NameLab6, a class to 
hold and process the queue named Lab6Queue, and a class called Patron that will hold the customer 
data. The Patron class has two private fields to hold the customer data; a string to hold the 
customer’s name and an integer to hold the number of guests in the customer’s party. The Lab5Queue 
class has an array-based queue of ten elements that will hold instances of our Patron class. The 
NameLab6 class contains the main method that has a two-option menu for the user to either 
enqueue or dequeue a patron object. The menu contains a loop that will allow the user to 
continue to enqueue and dequeue patrons until a sentinel value is entered. If the user decides to add a 
new patron to the queue (enqueue), it should prompt the user to enter the patrons name and the 
number of guests in the patron’s party. It should then add it to the queue. If the user decides to remove 
a name (dequeue) it should display the patron’s name and the number of guests in the patron’s party 
before removing it from the queue. The user receives an error message when trying to remove a 
patron from an empty queue or traying to add a patron to a full queue.

- The project consisted of a function "toPirate"  that takes an English word in the form of a string as a parameter and returns the word to Pirate.

Inspirations
-
- Creativity: Creating interactive programs that give power to the user is a difficult task to complete. The ability to handle the inputs from the user are challenging but if done correctly, can help bring out the creativity of a individual. The "text particle" program is a awesome demonstration of how there are endless possibilites to program design. Changing the font color of a word is different but changing its form, particle flow, and speed, makes it unique. Something as simple as changing the design of a simple word sparks creativity. This project has motivated me to be creative in my designs because nothing is common in coding. Project Refrence:  https://codepen.io/Gthibaud/pen/pyeNKj

- Modularity: Modern software systsms typically consisty of serveral differnt components that must interact correctly in order for the entier system to work properly. Keeping these interactions straight requires that these different components be well organized. The "Animated Weather Cards" program showcases how making seperate functional units can produce a masterpiece. While each panel may consist of different algorithms, when put together they create a useful application that saves time for the user. This project is one reason why I strive to make my programs organized and robust so that they can function not only to be aesthetically pleasing, but to also function with future implemenations like adding updates or being introduced into another program. https://codepen.io/ste-vg/pen/GqaZbo

- Problem Solving: To be a programmer, one of the biggest hurdles is finding solutions. The most intricate, stunning programs are not perfect and have been through numerous revisions and set backs. While the ideas may seem simple to complete like the "mouse ball animation" project, there had to be some type of analysis in figuring out how to make the program run. This challenge to find a way to make complex designs from scratch inspires me to continue to the path to become a great programmer. Programmers are people who do not settle for less and strive to find an answer. I never liked being complacent but enjoyed trying new things that sparked my mind because there is always something new to learn. This project has showed me the problem solving is not a task but a skill that leads to creative desings. Project refrence: https://codepen.io/renatorib/pen/xxWemq

Focus:
-
- One area I would like to focus on more within computer programming is data structures. As awesome it would be to learn how to create beautiful designs on html or css, I enjoy creating small and large data programs that house users data. I find it true art to be able to collect millions of data from users and organize in a systematic way that can be used in the future. I would like to learn more about what algorithms are used to created file libraries, or even registration systems for events. Data structures are used in all sorts of programs like games that save a users progrss or music programs like spotify that keep track of a users playlist which shows how versitile these programs are. Some of the areas I want to learn more about are tree structures, queues, stacks, and large data sets.
